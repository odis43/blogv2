Dune is probably the best sci-fi you will encounter and I am ready to die on that
hill. It's a mature, and complex story that is rich with intersting lore and worlds
that actually feel as alive as they were written to be. If you are a sci-fi fan, you should
seriously consider reading the book or at least watching Denis Villneuve's adaptation
(or both).

## What is Dune?

<br />
First, some world building.
<br />
Dune is set in the year 10,000 where humans live in houses under the rule of a Galactic
Emperor. This "institution" is called the <b>Imperium</b>. Although there are many houses
in the Imperium, we are only introduced to <b> House Atreides </b> led by Duke Leto Atraides,
their enemies <b> House Harkonnen </b>led by Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, and the Emperor Shaddam
IV's<b> House Corrino </b>. In the world of Dune, the <b>Spice Melange</b> (or "the spice") is a substance used for meta-technological developements, and neu.
It's vital for space travel by enabling Guild Navigators to see safe paths between the stars, making it the most valuable resource in the universe. Only problem is, it only grows on one planet: Arrakis.
<br />

Dune has been regarded as a big influence for modern day sci-fi. Many motifs found
in modern day sci-fi products originated from the world of Dune - but we'll get to
that later.

<br />
So what happens in Dune?
