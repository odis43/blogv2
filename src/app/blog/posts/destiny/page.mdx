# My obsession with Destiny

###### {metadata.snippet}

Published: {metadata.publishDate}

It's the summer of 2014 and 10 year old me is watching Youtube (as one does on a lazy weekend). Among the sea of thumbnails, one catches my eye - an enigmatic solider from the future with the title reading: "Official Destiny Gameplay Reveal Video".

At the time, I only owned a PSVITA and was in utter shock at the beauty and sheer technical grace that I was witnessing. I didn't grow up with Halo or any shooters for that matter, so even simple things like being able to see your first person characters legs blew my mind. For the next couple months, all I could think about was Destiny. I watched every trailer, every vidoc and even at 10 years old, I knew this game was going to be something special. Fast forward to a couple weeks before my 11th birthday, Destiny has been released worldwide and I found out that my best friend at the time had a copy. I asked if he would bring it and his xbox to my party, and that he did. I remember having so much fun playing as a temporary Guardian with a Stranger’s rifle for the first time and thinking back, it was one of those moments that I’ll never forget. After my birthday, I asked my dad for a PS3 and a copy of Destiny and fast forward again a month or two; sitting underneath the TV was a Playstation 3 but most importantly, my favorite video game of all time.

I played the living shit out of this game. Every mission, every strike, and every raid (well there was just one at release but I’ll get to raids later). Enduring countless wipes and experiencing moments like the Gorgon maze and the final battle were seriously some of the most impactful moments I’ve had in gaming. I even made some great friendships through raiding and it made me realize that the Destiny community is unlike any community out there in the video game space. So, lets talk about my experience in detail as the years went by.
