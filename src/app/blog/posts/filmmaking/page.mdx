Life of Kariza, Gaux art, Obe Williams.  These are some creators in the cinematic space that I've lately been obsessed with.  Their shot composition, lighting, colour grading and story telling are all so damn inspiring, it makes me want to pick up a camera and start doing the same.
<br/>

I went on a whim (and a really good sale), and bought myself the Sony ZV-E10 - a great beginner camera that's marketed as a vlogger cam but I've seen some really cool stuff filmed on it.  I know that good videography is very dependent on the shot composition and creativity of the person but the camera is the tool with which all of this is possible so naturally, I am very excited to shoot stuff on this beast of a video camera. 

<br/>
I have a couple ideas in the works, each one iterating on some type of filmmaking concept whether that be diverse shot lists or creative color grading (I found myself really enjoying the latter so I'll speak about that later).

This is my first "film" ever, filmed on a very foggy night. I didn't storyboard or plan the shots, I went out to film as soon as I got home from a friend's house.

    As you can tell, a large aspect of the short video was the use of my clones. Funny enough, it was the first "intermediate" editing technique I learned so I made sure to really hammer it down for this movie.  It was also my first time colorgrading.  I shot the whole thing in S-Log2 in the ITU709Matrix color space (which I learned is the optimal color space from: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O09W5xvIG14&t=191s&pp=ygUUc29ueSB6di1lMTAgd29ya2Zsb3c%3D"><b>this guy</b></a>) so I was really able to color the movie to my liking.  It wasn't anything crazy, just 4 nodes to adjust exposure, white balance, saturation and the overall look.  Still, node based coloring was really fun to do especially to try out how various tones impacted the well, tone of the movie.
