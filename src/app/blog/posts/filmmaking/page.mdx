Life of Kariza, Gaux art, Obe Williams.  These are some creators in the cinematic space that I've lately been obsessed with.  Their shot composition, lighting, colour grading and story telling are all so damn inspiring, it makes me want to pick up a camera and start doing the same.
<br/>

Only problem is, I don't have one.
<br />
I know that good videography is very dependent on the shot composition and creativity of the person but the camera is the tool with which all of this is possible. All I have at my disposal is a dinky iPhone 11 (<b>update: I didn't realize it could shoot 4k video so this opinion has drastically changed</b>) and an old Canon eos t3 that shoots 720p. My most immediate goal is to create a short film about this very dilemma to prove to myself that I have genuine passion (because I'm not sure if this is just a phase) and then seek out one of two cameras I've been looking at - the <b>Sony a6700</b> and the <b>Sony ZV-E10 </b>.
<br/>
So come along with me as I share with you my notes for a video I'm titling: <b> My new camera </b>

<br/>

## The shots

<br/>
Right now, I don't really know what the story will be but I do know the kinds of shots that I absolutely want to try and shoot. I've been heavily referencing this website called, <b><a target="_blank" href="https://eyecannndy.com">EYECANDY</a></b> to get an idea of these shot compositions and are some of my favourites.

These shots I think offer the best diversity in terms of video composition, which will hopefully keep you guys engaged to keep watching till the end ðŸ¤­.  But now, a new problem arises: how the hell do I get these shots??
<br/>
## The flash cut
<br/>
This one is fairly simple, with a large chunk of it to be done in editing. I want to focus on the word "Sony", as I search for it online in this video so the idea is that that I'd center each variation of the word in Davinci and Flash cut through them all creating the desired effect.  Whew, not too bad so far.
<br/>
## SnorriCam
<br />
Okay, this one is a little bit of a headache but still not too bad.  This shot requires a tripod - the goal being to balance the it on my chest with the camera pointed toward me. The challenges: I can't see how I look like, and I keeping the tripod stable on my chest as I move may prove to be difficult.  I've looked online and the best (budget) solution is to use shoelace.  Yes that's right, I'll use shoelace to fasten everything on to my chest.  Seems, easy enough!
<br/>
## Fixed cam
<br/>
I think this shot may be the hardest.  Much like the gif, I want to capture me jotting something down through the perspective of the pen, meaning I'd need to somehow fasten my phone to the pencil to get the desired effect.
<br/>
## Lighting
<br/>
Arguably the most important aspect of filmmaking (or so everyone I've watched keeps saying it is).  I want to really hone in on lighting since that was never a focus for any videos I've made prior.  I bought this $30

I think his shots are pretty unique since he uses both warm and cool lighting for almost every scene which creates a pretty interesting image to look at.  He also uses fog which definitely brings up that "cinematic" quality a lot of filmmakers aspire to capture.
